## Description

Repeat the following exercises from a previous unit using flexbox to structure 
the page.

In a readme.md file, compare the two approaches in terms of:
● Result
● Code quality
● Future flexibility




# Comparison Between Float and Flexbox Layouts


## 1. Result

### Float Layout
- **Layout Control**: The layout works with columns side by side, but precise alignment often requires complex width and margin calculations.
- **Common Issues**: Requires "clearfix" to handle container collapse issues caused by floating elements.

### Flexbox Layout
- **Layout Control**: Flexbox makes it easy to align and space out elements without manual calculations,columns adjust naturally based on the container size.


## 2. Code Quality

### Float Layout
- **Readability**: The code is more complex, requiring additional properties such as `float`, `clear`, `width`, and manual adjustments to handle issues inherent to the float system.

### Flexbox Layout
- **Readability**: the code is much cleaner and easier to follow, flexbox reduces the need for additional properties, leading to simpler, more readable code.



## 3. Future Flexibility

### Float Layout
- **Adaptability**: Modifying or updating a layout based on floats can be time-consuming and tricky, especially with more complex structures.

### Flexbox Layout
- **Adaptability**: Flexbox provides great flexibility for changes, such as reordering elements, aligning content, and adjusting spacing, without major rewrites.
